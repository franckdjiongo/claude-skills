description: >-
  Adversarial multi-agent review of the diff BEFORE a pull request is opened (Mode A), and one bounded pass over bot review comments (Mode B). Use when about to create or open a PR ("ouvre la PR") or when a bot comments. Non-draft PRs and ready require review PASS for exact HEAD. Two rounds max.

# Adversarial PR Review

Attack your own diff before the PR is public, fix only what matters with the smallest change, and finish. `scripts/review-run.mjs` owns the bookkeeping (repo and HEAD, round count, verdict, sentinel). You own the judgment: finding bugs and choosing dispositions.

## Hard rules

1. **Round cap: 2 rounds, NOT overridable by any plan or prompt** ("until convergence" is overruled). A round is one full dimension fan-out plus its Verify step; a per-fix verifier is not a round. Round 1 reviews the whole diff. Round 2 reviews the delta plus direct interactions AND re-judges the round-1 remarks (CHIP and WONT_FIX, not HORS) whose area a fix touched; a remark on untouched lines is INVALID. Each round-2 fix gets a fresh verifier that states whether it changes an existing behaviour or violates a plan prohibition. Never a 3rd round: a P1 open after round 2 means not converged. The cap counts per cycle across Mode A and B. After a FAIL, only an in-scope chip fixing its blocking finding (out of scope: own branch) opens a second, last cycle, `start --new-cycle <chip-id>`: whole diff, `cross` in round 1, same fix budget. A second FAIL: the PR stays draft, the user decides. The script enforces both.
2. **Every finding gets one disposition:** FIX (a P1, a P2 that serves the chantier intent, or a non-pre-existing finding the end user sees whose fix fits in ~10 lines), CHIP (only a user-visible effect, and only if the plan allows chips; `spawn_task`), WONT_FIX (one-line reason) or INVALID (its facts do not hold). A pre-existing finding is never FIX unless P1. A remark contradicting a written decision of the plan or intent sheet is WONT_FIX unless P1. A fix counts code + tests: over 30 lines per finding, or a round growing a PR of 200+ lines by over 15 %, first try a version that removes code, else `fix --subtractive-tried "<why>"` or CHIP and a draft PR. A fix its verifier rejects is never retried: CHIP (a rejected P1 means not converged). A finding whose only fix is a test, with no observed defect, is WONT_FIX unless a sheet guarantee has no proof (D2, D6). The script rejects what breaks this.
3. **Simplifier, once per PR (D5).** If an intent sheet exists (`.chantier/<slug>/intention.md`, or the plan's `Fiche d'intention :` line), after the last round and before the PR (once per slice PR), run the `simplificateur` agent, fresh context, per
   `~/.claude/skills/brief-chantier/references/simplificateur.md` (in a cloud clone:
   `.claude/skills/brief-chantier/references/simplificateur.md`), then `finalize --simplifier <sha>|none`. No sheet: say so, never block.
4. **Closure never blocks an autonomous run.** After the cap, commit, push, `finalize`. PASS: open the PR (body per Mode A step 4). FAIL: no sentinel; open only a draft PR (`gh pr create --draft` or MCP with `draft: true`), listing open findings and dispositions in its body. Never wait for a human, run past the cap or forge the sentinel.
5. **Prefer real execution evidence to more mocked tests.**
6. **Every verification claim names a check actually run that can prove it.** "Typecheck clean" needs an unfiltered run (a `| grep` pipe proves only the absence of the grepped text). Write the command and its observed output, or "not run".

## The script

`node <this skill's folder>/scripts/review-run.mjs <command>`, from the reviewed checkout or with `--repo <absolute path>`. It resolves repo, worktree and HEAD itself (no hand-typed `cd`).

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `start [--base <ref>] [--new-cycle <chip-id>]` | Prints HEAD, base, `newFiles` (the inventory), `newFilesSinceLastRound`, intent sheets, rounds left, the round-file shape. |
| `round <file> [--triage] [--head <sha>]` | Records a round from a JSON file (its shape is printed by `start`). `--triage` records bot-comment dispositions once the cap is spent. `--head`: commit an external pass reviewed (HEAD or ancestor). |
| `adopt <other-checkout>` | Moves this branch's state and sentinel from another worktree here (refuses other branch or non-empty state). |
| `fix <id...> [--subtractive-tried "<why>"]` | Marks FIX findings fixed, after the fix commit and its fresh verifier; refuses a fix over the rule-2 bounds without `<why>`. |
| `cross [--author claude\|codex]` | Billed read-only review by the other model family, round 1 only (`--author` is your own runtime). Findings get ids `X<n>`, each needing a disposition. |
| `finalize --gate <cmd>` | Runs the gate, prints code, tests and tests/code, writes `verdict.json`, and the sentinel only on PASS for HEAD. Also `--simplifier <sha>\|none`, `--delta-ok "<note>"`, `--trivial`, `--no-gate "<reason>"` (recorded as skipped, never as a gate pass). Exit 0 only on PASS. |
| `check [--head <sha>]` | Exit 0 only for a PASS on that HEAD. 1 FAIL, 3 absent or stale, 4 voided by later findings. |

Your report cites `verdict.json`, not your own words.

## Mode A: before opening a PR

1. `start`. Run the local quality gate; fix red before spending agents.
2. **Round 1** on the whole diff: hunters and `cross` in parallel (D1; `cross` failed or CLI not logged in: no retry, say so); `round` once `cross` is done, its X findings dispositioned in it; commit the FIX items, `fix`, re-run the gate.
3. **Round 2**, only if round 1 committed a fix: same steps on the delta.
4. Simplifier, then `finalize --gate '<the gate>'`, push, open the PR. The body states coverage, gate result, its printed figures and open findings with dispositions.
5. **Read the bot's first pass before any merge**: `gh pr view <n> --json comments,reviews` and the PR's review comments via `gh api`. Its findings go to Mode B.

## Mode B: bot review comments

One bounded pass, not ping-pong: `references/mode-b.md`.

## The review engine

**What a hunter may report** (trigger, origin proven base against HEAD, classes, P1-P3 severity) is the `CONTEXT` block of `references/workflow-template.js`. Read it before any triage.

### 1. Inventory

<!-- runtime-slot:engine-intro -->
With ultracode/workflows enabled (`CLAUDE_CODE_WORKFLOWS=1`) use the **Workflow tool**, otherwise parallel
`Agent` subagents (same shape, fewer agents). Key the choice on the environment, never on the user's wording.
Locally, in auto mode, the Workflow tool launches without a dialog. A cloud routine prompts at every launch
and nobody can click: use the hand-launched fan-out there.
<!-- /runtime-slot:engine-intro -->

Give each category of the diff at least one dimension: application code (`correctness`, `scalability`, `platform-limits`), enforcement or tooling code (`tooling-effectiveness`), docs and agent instructions (`wiring-and-contract`), schema or contract surfaces (`contracts`, `blast-radius`). The PR headline never picks them. New enforcement code makes the diff Large/risky.

`NEW_FILES` is the `newFiles` list from `start` (round 2: `newFilesSinceLastRound`). If `start` fails, preflight is `INCOMPLETE`: never infer an empty inventory.

### 2. Hunt

<!-- runtime-slot:template-intro -->
The Workflow template is `references/workflow-template.js`. Fill `REPO`, `NEW_FILES`, `INVENTORY_COMPLETE`,
`ROUND` (and `ROUND1_SHA` for round 2) and trim `DIMENSIONS` to the inventory.
<!-- /runtime-slot:template-intro -->

Each wholly-new file is a named target of one dimension. Hunters return `findings`, `sweeps` (per class or target: sites checked, verdict `clean`, `finding-filed` + `findingRef`, or `not-examined`) and `residualRisk`. What is not written there counts as not done.

<!-- runtime-slot:model-policy -->
**Model policy: no Opus subagents.** Hunters run `model:'sonnet', effort:'medium'`, verifiers `model:'sonnet',
effort:'high'`, pinned in the agent options: a hunt or verify never inherits the session model. The rigor
comes from the protocol (second round on the delta, executed proofs, independent verify), not from the model
tier. The Verify step is not optional.
<!-- /runtime-slot:model-policy -->

### 3. Verify adversarially

One independent verifier per finding tries to refute it: it checks the facts, the trigger and the origin, sets `mustFix`, cites the repo idiom or limit for a non-correctness finding and lists `checksPerformed` as "command → observed output". Dedupe confirmed findings by file and line.

**The hand-launched fan-out drops the Workflow tool, never a phase.** Agents return the same `findings`, `sweeps`, `residualRisk` and `checksPerformed`. Apply the EVIDENCE FORM, SHARED MACHINE and SHELL clauses of the template's hunt prompt, use the `newFiles` list from `start`, run one verifier agent per finding. Your own re-read counts only with its `checksPerformed` in the thread.

### 4. Read the results

Read `notExaminedSweeps`, `uncoveredTargets` (silence, not a pass), `inconsistentSweeps` and `residualRisks` every round; re-ask or examine each. What stays open goes in `openQuestions`: no PASS while any remains.

### 5. Disposition and minimal fix

Disposition every confirmed finding, `round`, then launch ONE fixer per round. It writes only in the chantier's repo (absolute path in its prompt), only the FIX remarks, minimal and covering the whole family of the defect. For each FIX sweep its class across the ENTIRE diff: literal twins (grep the signature) and structural twins (same invariant, another integration point). Emit the table yourself: every grep hit with a disposition (swept, has-guard, not-in-class and why).

<!-- runtime-slot:agent-deaths -->
**Agents dying mid-run (rate limits).** Do not restart the round or respawn agents one by one. Relaunch the
SAME Workflow script with `resumeFromRunId: <runId>`: finished agents return from cache, only the dead ones
re-run. A dead fixer is continued with `SendMessage` using its agentId, context intact.
<!-- /runtime-slot:agent-deaths -->

## Sentinel

The global hook `adversarial-pr-guard.mjs` blocks non-draft `gh pr create`, `gh pr ready` and non-draft MCP pull-request creation tools unless the **current HEAD** (with `--head <branch>`: that branch's tip) is recorded as reviewed. It reads `<git-dir>/.adversarial-review-passed`. Only `finalize` writes it, only on PASS: never by hand, never to skip a review (a security incident). A later commit makes it stale. If the hook blocks despite a PASS, stop and report an infra failure.

**After the last round the cap allows**, `finalize --delta-ok "<note>"` re-records without a new round only if `git diff <last-reviewed-sha>..HEAD` holds nothing but (a) fixes of confirmed findings, each with its own fresh verifier, (b) quality-gate repairs changing no reviewed behavior, (c) a conflict-free base merge (`git show --remerge-diff <merge>` prints no hunk), (d) the removal of the intent sheet, (e) the simplifier commit. A fresh verifier classifies every hunk; an unclassifiable one means not converged.

**Codex in round 1 (D1).** `cross` reviews the whole diff alongside the round-1 hunters. No external pass after a green PR: it opens a third round.

## Scaling & cost

Trivial (typo, comment, one line, config): no fan-out, read the diff, `finalize --trivial`. Small: 2-3 dimensions, single-vote verify. Medium: 4-5. Large/risky (auth, schema, public API, shared dispatch, migration): all dimensions, 3-vote verify, `cross` in every round 1.

`finalize` computes **converged**: every FIX fixed, no open P1 or question, every cross finding dispositioned, a green gate, no HEAD movement after the last round without `--delta-ok`. Always report the residual risk: what was swept, what still surfaced, what was not re-verified.
