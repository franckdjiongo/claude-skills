  Syncs the current Power Apps Code App to the Fernand Gilbert Ltée Azure DevOps
  repository under code-apps/<app-name>/. Use this skill whenever the user wants
  to push or sync a code app to the company repo, share their work with the team,
  or says anything like "push to company", "sync to azure", "deploy to azure devops",
  "update the company repo", "push to FGL", "push to Fernand Gilbert", "envoyer dans
  le repo de la compagnie", or finishes a feature and wants colleagues to have access.
  Also use this skill proactively when the user completes a meaningful change and
  mentions wanting to share or hand off the work.

# Sync Code App to Azure DevOps

Syncs the current working directory to `code-apps/<app-name>/` in the Fernand Gilbert Ltée
Azure DevOps repository. Does **not** build — syncs source as-is. Cross-platform: uses
`rsync` on macOS/Linux and `robocopy` on Windows/Git Bash.

**Excluded from sync** — dirs: `.claude/`, `.agents/`, `.codex/`, `.git/`, `node_modules/`,
`dist/`, `docs/`; files: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `*.local`, `.env*`.

> **Safety property:** the script commits **only inside the Azure mirror** at
> `~/.fgl-azure/repo`. It never creates a commit in the user's own project repo, on any
> branch. Syncing therefore cannot move one branch's work onto another.

---

## Which branch gets synced

The sync copies the **working tree as it is on disk**, i.e. whatever branch is currently
checked out. To sync a **different** branch (e.g. `master` instead of a feature/loop branch):

1. Confirm the working tree is **clean** (`git status --porcelain` empty). If not, stop and
   ask the user — never stash/commit on their behalf to force it.
2. `git checkout <branch>` (a plain checkout — **never** `merge`/`rebase`; switching branches
   does not move the previous branch's commits anywhere).
3. Run the sync (see below).
4. `git checkout <original-branch>` to return the user where they were.

Always switch back to the branch the user started on once the sync is done.

---

## PAT Setup (automatic)

On the **first run**, the script prompts for your Personal Access Token and saves it to
`~/.fgl-azure/.pat` (chmod 600 — readable only by you). You will never be prompted again.
The prompt is interactive (`read -s`) — if there's no TTY, the user must run that first run
themselves in their terminal, or pre-create `~/.fgl-azure/.pat`.

To create a PAT: Azure DevOps → profile picture (top right) → **Personal access tokens**
→ **New Token** → Scopes: **Code → Read & Write**.

> To reset the PAT (e.g. after expiry): `rm ~/.fgl-azure/.pat` then re-run the script.

## Commit message — must MEAN something to a colleague

The company Azure repo collapses **many** of the user's granular personal commits into **one**
sync commit. That single message is the only thing a teammate reading the company history will
see — so it MUST explain *what was actually done*, not file counts. It is **never** the source
branch's last commit subject.

How the message is built — a **changelog since the last sync**, not a diff stat:

- Each sync commit is stamped with a provenance trailer `Source-commit: <source HEAD sha>`
  (the script does this automatically).
- **`sync.sh --stage-only`** clones/pulls the mirror, copies the source in, stages it, and
  prints both the file delta (`--stat`/`--name-status`) **and the source commits since the last
  sync** — `git log <previous Source-commit>..HEAD` for THIS app (it reads the `Source-commit`
  trailer of the last mirror commit carrying this app's `Sync-app:` marker). That list is the raw
  material for the message.
- **`sync.sh -m "<message>"`** re-stages, commits with your message (auto-appending the new
  `Source-commit:` trailer), and pushes.

Running `sync.sh` with no arguments still works for manual use: it commits an auto-generated
stat-based summary (e.g. `temps-chantier-code-app: sync — 8 fichier(s) modifié(s) (src, public)`).
That fallback is the *bad* message we want to avoid — always drive it via `--stage-only` + `-m`.

## How Claude Should Use This Skill

1. Confirm the user is in a Code App project root (must have `package.json`).
2. **Branch check:** if the user wants a specific branch (e.g. `master`), follow
   *Which branch gets synced* above — clean tree → `git checkout <branch>` → (sync) →
   `git checkout` back afterwards.
3. **Inspect the delta + changelog:**
   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude/skills/sync-to-azure/scripts/sync.sh --stage-only
   ```
   Read the printed file delta AND the **source commits since the last sync** — that commit
   list is what you summarise.
4. **Write a MEANINGFUL message:** synthesise the changelog into a Conventional-Commits message
   a teammate could understand — a clear subject + (when the delta spans several themes) a short
   bulleted body grouping the work (feat / fix / ST / refactor …). Describe *what was done*, not
   how many files. If `--stage-only` reported "no provenance trailer" (first trailer-tracked
   sync), summarise the recent commits it printed instead.
5. **Show the message to the user and WAIT for approval** before pushing — it goes to the
   company repo. Do not push until they confirm (adjust the message if they ask).
6. **Commit & push** (auto-stamps the `Source-commit:` trailer):
   ```bash
   bash ~/.claude/skills/sync-to-azure/scripts/sync.sh -m "<approved message>"
   ```
7. If you switched branches in step 2, `git checkout` back to the user's original branch.
8. Report the app name synced and the exact commit message that was pushed.

## Reminder system (so a master push is never forgotten)

Pushing `master` to the **personal GitHub** does NOT auto-sync to Azure (the sync needs the
local PAT, and a good message needs Claude). Instead, two machine-local reminders fire — never
an auto-sync, by design:

- **git `pre-push` hook** → `temps-chantier-code-app/.husky/pre-push` (husky v9). On a push that
  includes `master`, it shows a macOS notification + stderr line "pense à /sync-to-azure". Fires
  for **every local push, including VS Code's Push button** (VS Code runs git hooks). It NEVER
  blocks the push (`set +e`, always `exit 0`). Kept machine-local: listed in `.git/info/exclude`
  (untracked) and excluded from the Azure sync — it must not reach the company repo.
- **SessionStart drift-check** → wired in the project's `.claude/settings.local.json`, runs
  `scripts/session-drift-notice.sh`. When Claude Code opens in this project and the mirror is
  **behind** master, it injects a note so Claude reminds the user. Silent when in sync/unknown.
  This is the catch-all for pushes the local hook can't see (e.g. claude.ai cloud routines).

Both rely on `scripts/drift-status.sh`, which compares local `master` to the last synced source
SHA — the `Source-commit:` trailer of the most recent mirror commit carrying this app's
`Sync-app:` marker (found via `git log --grep`, so an empty provenance-marker commit counts too).
Until the first provenance-stamped commit exists, drift is reported `UNKNOWN` (the hook still
reminds on a master push; the session check stays silent).

## Troubleshooting Reference

| Symptom                    | Fix                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Authentication failed`    | PAT expired — `rm ~/.fgl-azure/.pat`, create a new PAT, then re-run the script |
| `Clone failed`             | Check VPN/network and confirm PAT has **Code Read & Write** scope              |
| `Push failed after rebase` | Manual conflict in `~/.fgl-azure/repo` — resolve then re-run                   |
| Wrong app name used        | Add `"name": "<your-app-name>"` field to `power.config.json`                   |
| `No package.json found`    | You're not in the Code App root — `cd` to the right folder first               |
| Synced the wrong branch    | Checkout the intended branch (clean tree) and re-run — see *Which branch gets synced* |
| No copy tool found         | Need `rsync` (macOS/Linux) or `robocopy` (Windows) on `PATH`                   |
| No reminder on master push | `.husky/pre-push` must exist + be executable; husky uses `core.hooksPath=.husky/_` |
| Drift always `UNKNOWN`     | Normal until the first trailer-stamped sync — re-sync once so the mirror carries `Source-commit:` |
