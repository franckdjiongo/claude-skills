name: doc-consolidator
description: Consolidate multiple related documents into a single unified reference. Use when the user asks to merge, consolidate, combine, or unify multiple documents (markdown, technical references, guides, policies, procedures) into one comprehensive document. Triggers on requests like "consolidate these docs", "merge these files into one", "combine these references", "create unified documentation from these files", or when user uploads multiple related documents and wants them merged. Preserves all unique technical content while eliminating redundancy.

# Document Consolidator

Merge multiple related documents into a single, well-organized reference while preserving all unique content and eliminating redundancy.

## Workflow

1. **Inventory** — List all input documents with paths
2. **Analyze** — Read each document completely, noting structure and topics
3. **Map** — Identify overlapping sections and unique content per document
4. **Outline** — Create merged structure before writing
5. **Consolidate** — Write unified document following the outline
6. **Deliver** — Save to outputs directory and present to user

## Analysis Phase

Read each document and create a mental map:

```
Document A:
- Section 1: [topic] — unique/overlaps with Doc B Section X
- Section 2: [topic] — unique
- Section 3: [topic] — overlaps with Doc B Section Y (Doc A more complete)

Document B:
- Section X: [topic] — overlaps with Doc A Section 1 (Doc B more complete)
- Section Y: [topic] — overlaps with Doc A Section 3
- Section Z: [topic] — unique
```

## Merge Rules

**Overlapping content:**
- Keep the most complete/accurate version
- If both add value, synthesize into single comprehensive section
- Preserve all technical details, code examples, tables

**Unique content:**
- Include everything — do not discard unless exact duplicate
- Maintain original technical accuracy (no paraphrasing specs/code)

**Conflicts:**
- If documents contradict, note both perspectives or keep most recent
- For technical specs, prefer the more detailed version

## Output Structure

Standard document flow:

```
1. Title (indicate consolidated nature)
2. Table of Contents (if >500 lines)
3. Executive Summary / Overview
4. Core Concepts / Architecture
5. Implementation / How-To Sections
6. Reference Tables / Quick References
7. Troubleshooting / Common Issues
8. Sources / References
```

Adapt structure to document type — technical references differ from policy documents.

## Formatting Standards

- Consistent heading levels (H1 title, H2 major sections, H3 subsections)
- Uniform code block language tags
- Standardized table formatting
- Consistent list styles (bullets vs numbers)
- Preserve all original code examples verbatim

## Constraints

- **Do NOT** summarize or condense technical details
- **Do NOT** add information not in source documents
- **Do NOT** remove content unless exact duplication
- **Do NOT** paraphrase code, configurations, or specifications
- **Preserve** all tables, diagrams-as-text, structured data

## Output Location

Save consolidated document to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` with descriptive filename indicating consolidated nature (e.g., `Topic_Consolidated_Reference.md`).

## Quality Checklist

Before delivering:
- [ ] All source documents fully read
- [ ] No unique content lost
- [ ] Overlapping content merged (not duplicated)
- [ ] Logical section ordering
- [ ] Consistent formatting throughout
- [ ] Table of contents if >500 lines
- [ ] File saved to outputs directory
