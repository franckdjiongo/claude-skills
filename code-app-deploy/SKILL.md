  Deploy a Power Apps code app to production, manage application lifecycle, configure security,
  set up monitoring, and troubleshoot issues. Covers build/push, solutions, Power Platform
  Pipelines, Content Security Policy, SDK migration, Azure App Insights, CLI telemetry, and
  diagnostic workflows for PAC CLI failures including SSL proxy issues. Use this skill whenever
  the user wants to deploy a code app, push to an environment, add an app to a solution, configure
  CSP, set up monitoring, migrate SDK versions, or troubleshoot "pac code" failures. Also triggers
  on: "pac code push", "npx power-apps push", "deploy to Power Platform", "add to solution",
  "configure CSP", "set up App Insights for code app", "pac code add-data-source fails",
  "fetch failed", "UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE", "Zscaler certificate", or any deployment,
  ALM, security, monitoring, or troubleshooting question about Power Apps code apps.

# Power Apps Code App — Deploy & Operate

Guide developers through deployment, ALM, security configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

- For deployment, ALM, security, and monitoring: [references/deployment-and-alm.md](references/deployment-and-alm.md)
- For diagnostic workflows and troubleshooting: [references/troubleshooting-guide.md](references/troubleshooting-guide.md)

## Deployment Workflow

### Build & Push

**npm CLI (recommended):**
```bash
npm run build
npx power-apps push
```

**PAC CLI (legacy):**
```bash
npm run build | pac code push
# Target a specific solution:
npm run build | pac code push --solutionName <solutionName>
```

### Add to a Solution

Apps are automatically saved to the **preferred solution** when using `pac code push`.
To add manually: Power Apps portal > Solutions > [solution] > Add existing > App > Code app.

### Multi-Environment Deployment

Use **Power Platform Pipelines** to promote through dev → test → prod:
- Pipelines run preflight checks (dependencies, connection references)
- Connection references decouple data connections from environment-specific settings
- Each environment can have its own connection configurations

## Security — Content Security Policy

CSP controls which content sources are allowed. Configure at environment level:

**UI path:** Power Platform Admin Center > Environments > Settings > Product > Privacy + Security > App (CSP tab)

**Key directives:** `connect-src` (API endpoints), `script-src` (JavaScript sources), `style-src` (CSS), `img-src`, `font-src`

For programmatic configuration (CI/CD), use PowerShell or REST API — see the deployment reference.

## Monitoring — Azure App Insights

```typescript
import { ApplicationInsights } from '@microsoft/applicationinsights-web';
import { setConfig } from '@microsoft/power-apps/app';

const appInsights = new ApplicationInsights({
  config: { connectionString: '<your-connection-string>' }
});
appInsights.loadAppInsights();

setConfig({
  logger: {
    logMetric: (value) => {
      appInsights.trackEvent({ name: value.type }, value.data);
    }
  }
});
```

Built-in metrics: `sessionLoadSummary` (app load performance), `networkRequest` (API call timing).

## SDK v1.0 Migration

If migrating from SDK v0.3.21:
1. Remove all `initialize()` imports and calls
2. Remove initialization state management (`isInitialized` flags, `useEffect` guards)
3. Use SDK methods directly — no async initialization needed
4. Optionally configure `setConfig({ logger: ... })` for observability

## Quick Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| `TypeError: fetch failed` | SSL proxy (Zscaler) intercepting | Export proxy CA cert, set `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` |
| `ETIMEDOUT` / `ECONNRESET` | Network/DNS issue | Check connectivity, firewall rules |
| Wrong schema / data source not found | Wrong environment in config | Run `pac env who`, compare with `power.config.json` |
| `401` / `403` on data requests | Auth/permissions issue | Re-authenticate: `pac auth create` |
| CSP violation in console | Missing allowed source | Add URL to CSP directive in admin center |

For detailed diagnostic workflows, see the [troubleshooting reference](references/troubleshooting-guide.md).

## ALM Limitations

Code apps currently do **not** support:
- Solution Packager tool
- Power Platform Git integration (source control)

## What NOT to Do

- Do not use `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0` in production — it disables all SSL validation
- Do not skip CSP configuration when using external APIs or CDNs
- Do not store App Insights connection strings in app code — use Dataverse settings or environment detection
- Do not ignore preflight check failures in pipelines — they indicate missing dependencies
